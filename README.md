üåê Google Clarity Web3 Procurement Contract

This repository contains a **Clarity smart contract** that simulates how a company like **Google** could run **transparent, fair, and secure procurement** processes on the **Web3 Stacks blockchain**.  

It is designed as a **winning procurement contract framework**, where project owners post opportunities, vendors compete by submitting bids, evaluators score those bids, and winners are selected using a balanced scoring formula.
